# Methylation in Breast Cancer 

The goal of this project is to analyze the patterns in methylation across breast tumor, tumor-adjacent, opposite quadrant, and opposite breast tissue.

## Background

(Work in progress. Jotting down quick notes at the moment)

- Conventionally, breast cancer researchers have commonly used adjacent normal tissue as a comparison to tumor tissue in various genomic characterizations of breast cancer.
- The overarching hypothesis of this project is that the adjacent normal is in fact too similar to the tumor, sharing many of their genomic aberrations.
- We explore this hypothesis by comparing DNA methylations of tissues from tumor, tumor-adjacent, opposite quadrant, and opposite breast from breast cancer patients, as well as normal patients without breast cancer.
